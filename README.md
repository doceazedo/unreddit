# ðŸ¤“ unreddit

Like my other projects [UNTTV](https://github.com/doceazedo/unttv) and [UNSC](https://github.com/doceazedo/unsc), this one provides "unlimited access" to the Reddit API.

The difference is that **unreddit** exists purely because Reddit blocks API requests from Vercel. So, I built this as a simple proxy for my personal website to fetch Reddit data through it.
